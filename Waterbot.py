            "**Universal Solvent**: Water is often called the universal solvent because it can dissolve more substances than any other liquid. This is due to its polar nature, which allows it to interact with a variety of molecules, making it essential for transporting nutrients and waste in biological organisms.",
            "**Triple Point**: Water is one of the few substances that can exist in all three states of matter (solid, liquid, and gas) within the natural temperature and pressure ranges on Earth. Its 'triple point', where all three states coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium, occurs at 0.01Â°C and a specific pressure of 611.657 pascals."]
